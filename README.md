## Exploratory data analysis (Project 1)

My repository contains 2 folders: "Scripts" (with 5 R code files) and "Plots" (with 4 PNG files).

Each of the plot1 to plot4 script calls script "load_data", which loads the required part of dataset.
Then separate scripts (plot1 to plot4) construct plots (plot1 to plot4) corresponding to those, which are attached to folder "figure".
